The logical equivalent of Lx=b implemented (Dependency Graph)

1- Bellman optimality implementation and node selection

2- States as levels (priority for nodes is the selected levels )

3- State vectors and vectors for moved nodes (how many levels it is moved and the in-degree changed)

4- transitions prob for nodes
